# Predicting-Sleep-Metrics
### Peter Nguyen
## Introduction
The objective of this project is to implement a multiple linear regression model that effectively predicts how many hours of sleep a person is getting and the quality of their sleep. This prediction will be based on a set of specific factors, allowing us to gauge the influence of these elements on sleep patterns and provide insights into the persons sleep metrics.

Sleep is a vital aspect of overall health and well-being, influencing various physiological and psychological functions. Understanding the factors affecting sleep patterns and their implications on health is crucial. The Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset aims to provide insights between sleep metrics, and lifestyle factors among individuals.

While the dataset is synthetic, the analysis aims to mirror real-world scenarios, offering illustrative findings that may be extracted and interventions in the field of sleep health.

In pursuit of implementing a prediction model using multiple linear regression, I utilized w3schools as a resource to gain an understanding of the process.

By delving into a wide range of variables, we seek to unravel the intricate dynamics that contribute to variations in sleep patterns.
